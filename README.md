### Installation

Start by installing the project dependencies. Open your terminal, navigate to the project's root directory, and execute:

```bash
npm install
```

This command will install all the necessary dependencies defined in the `package.json` file.

### Development Commands

With dependencies installed, you can utilize the following npm scripts to manage your project's development lifecycle:

* `npm run dev`: Starts a local development server with hot reloading enabled.
* `npm run preview`: Serves your build output locally for preview before deployment.
* `npm run build`: Bundles your site into static files for production.

For detailed help with Astro CLI commands, visit [Astro's documentation](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/cli-reference/).

## Deployment

### Building Your Site

Before deployment, you need to create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates a `dist/` directory with your built site (configurable via [outDir in Astro](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/configuration-reference/#outdir)).
